# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `RasterBackend` (`backend::raster`) — direct rasterization into an RGBA pixel buffer; draws circles, rects, and lines with scanline algorithms (no anti-aliasing); SVG `Path` elements use tiny_skia for curves; text rendered via `fontdue` glyph rasterization (~0.08 ms for 15 labels vs 3–25 ms with resvg SVG overlay)
- `RasterBackend::render_scene()` → PNG bytes; `render_scene_to_pixmap()` → raw RGBA pixmap; `render_scene_to_rgba()` → `(width, height, Vec<u8>)`
- `RasterBackend::with_skip_text(bool)` — skip text rendering for maximum throughput when the frontend overlays its own labels
- Polars integration (`dataframe` module, feature `polars`) — `DataFrameExt` trait with `df.scatter("x", "y")`, `df.histogram("col", 30)`, etc.; builder methods like `ScatterPlot::new().with_xy(&df, "x", "y")`; `PlotDataError` for missing columns, wrong dtypes, and nulls

### Changed

- Feature `png` renamed to `raster`; `png` kept as a backward-compatible alias
- `fontdue` added as an optional dependency (feature `raster`) for direct text rasterization

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-04

### Added

- `SvgBackend` is now a proper struct with `with_pretty(bool)` — `SvgBackend::new().with_pretty(true)` emits one element per line with 2-space indentation and group-depth tracking; compact output is unchanged and remains the default; a backward-compat `const SvgBackend` shim keeps all existing call sites compiling without modification
- `impl Default for SvgBackend` added (fixes `new_without_default` Clippy lint)

### Changed

- Default font family is now `"DejaVu Sans, Liberation Sans, Arial, sans-serif"` (previously fell back to the browser/renderer default); propagated through `ComputedLayout` and `Figure::render` via a shared `DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY` constant
- `title_size` default increased from 16 → 18 px
- `tick_size` default increased from 10 → 12 px; margins auto-expand from `tick_size` so no text is clipped
- CLI `--width` / `--height` flags are now optional with no default; canvas size is auto-computed from plot content when omitted, allowing pie outside-label widening and other layout-sensitive plots to size themselves correctly; explicit `--width`/`--height` still takes precedence

### Fixed

- **Brick plot legend order** — strigar motif legend entries are now sorted by global letter (A → Z) so the most-frequent motif always appears first
- **Sankey z-order** — node labels are now emitted after ribbons rather than before them; labels are no longer painted over by coloured ribbon bands
- **UpSet count labels** — intersection size labels above bars are suppressed when the column is too narrow to fit the number without overlapping an adjacent label
- **Pie outside label / legend overlap** — canvas widening for outside labels was blocked when the CLI forced `layout.width = Some(800)`; fixed by making `BaseArgs.width`/`height` `Option<f64>` so the widening condition fires correctly when the user has not explicitly set a size
- **Manhattan `--top-n`** — top-N point labels were filtered by the genome-wide significance threshold before selection, producing no labels when no points exceeded it; labels now pick the top-N most significant points unconditionally
- **Phylo circular whitespace** — replaced the conservative `hpad = edge_pad + label_pad` padding with a direct minimum-clearance formula (`max_r = min(pw/2 − edge_pad − label_gap − chars×7, ph/2 − edge_pad − 7)`); on an 800×800 canvas with 23-character leaf labels the tree radius increases from 94 px to 194 px

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-02

### Added

- `Figure::with_figure_size(w, h)` — specify total figure dimensions and have cell sizes auto-computed to fit, accounting for padding, spacing, title height, and shared legend area

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings resolved: `type_complexity` in `TerminalBackend` (extracted `type Rgb = (u8, u8, u8)`), `manual_is_multiple_of` in `render_utils`, and `needless_range_loop` suppressed on intentional triangular matrix loops in chord rendering
- `test_missing_feature_error` / `test_missing_feature_pdf` marked `#[ignore]` — these tests check a compile-time feature gate and were producing false-positive failures when a stale binary built with `--features full` was present on disk
- CI Clippy step now runs with `-D warnings` — all warnings are errors

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- `kuva::prelude::*` — single-import module re-exporting all plot structs, `Plot`, `Layout`, `Figure`, `Theme`, `Palette`, render helpers, backends, annotations, and datetime utilities
- `Into<Plot>` for all 25 plot structs — write `plot.into()` instead of `Plot::Scatter(plot)`
- `render_to_svg(plots, layout) -> String` — full pipeline in one call
- `render_to_png(plots, layout, scale) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String>` — one-call PNG output (feature `png`)
- `render_to_pdf(plots, layout) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String>` — one-call PDF output (feature `pdf`)
- GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the mdBook documentation to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`

### Fixed

- Unresolved intra-doc links (`Rect`, `Text`, `Line`) in `backend::terminal` module doc

**Rendering**
- SVG output via `SvgBackend` (always available; no system dependencies)

- Vector PDF output via `PdfBackend` (feature: `pdf`; uses `svg2pdf`, pure Rust)
- `Figure` for multi-plot grid layouts with merged cells, shared axes, panel labels (A/B/C, a/b/c, 1/2/3, or custom), and shared legends
- Secondary y axis (`render_twin_y`)
- Date/time x and y axes with automatic tick granularity (`DateTimeAxis`)
- Log-scale x and y axes with 1-2-5 tick generation
- Custom tick formatting (`TickFormat`: Auto, Fixed, Integer, Sci, Percent, Custom)
- Text annotations with optional arrow at data coordinates
- Reference lines (horizontal/vertical) with optional label and dash pattern
- Shaded regions (horizontal/vertical fills)
- Theme support: Default, Dark, Publication, and custom themes
- Named colour palettes with modulo-wrapping index access: `category10`, `wong`, `okabe_ito`, `tol_bright`, `tol_muted`, `tol_light`, `ibm`, `pastel`, `bold`, and `Palette::custom()`

**CLI binary (`kuva`)**
- 22 subcommands covering all plot types: `scatter`, `line`, `bar`, `histogram`, `box`, `violin`, `pie`, `strip`, `waterfall`, `stacked-area`, `volcano`, `manhattan`, `candlestick`, `heatmap`, `hist2d`, `contour`, `dot`, `upset`, `chord`, `sankey`, `phylo`, `synteny`
- Auto-detects TSV/CSV delimiter; optional `--no-header` and `-d/--delimiter`
- `--color-by` for palette-assigned group series on scatter, line, strip
- `--theme`, `--palette`, `--colourblind` for appearance control
- `--log-x` / `--log-y` on applicable subcommands
- PNG and PDF output when built with the corresponding feature flags
- Hidden `kuva man` subcommand generates a `man(1)` page via `clap_mangen`
- `--terminal` flag renders plots directly in the terminal using Unicode braille (U+2800–U+28FF), full-block (`█`) fills, and ANSI 24-bit colour; ideal for HPC and remote-server workflows with no display; auto-detects terminal dimensions, overrideable with `--term-width` / `--term-height`; supported by all subcommands except `upset`

### Known limitations

- `kuva brick` CLI subcommand is not yet implemented (pending integration with bladerunner)
- Terminal rendering is not yet supported for `upset` (the command prints a message and exits cleanly; use `-o file.svg` instead)
- No Python or other language bindings
